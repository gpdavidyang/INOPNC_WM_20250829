# Markup Documents Data Access Inconsistency Fix

## Problem Summary
Two different views of the same markup documents data were showing inconsistent results:
- **Unified view** (문서 통합뷰): Displayed documents correctly
- **Document management** (문서함 관리 > 도면마킹문서함): Showed no data

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Database Schema Inconsistency
The database had conflicting migrations:
- `107_create_markup_documents.sql`: Created table **WITH** `location` column
- `20250102_remove_location_field.sql`: **REMOVED** the `location` column  
- `301_simple_rls_policies.sql`: Created RLS policies that still **referenced** the `location` column

### 2. API Logic Issues
- API endpoint tried to filter by `location` field that no longer existed
- Admin actions referenced the removed `location` column
- RLS policies were broken due to missing column references

### 3. Component Logic Issues
- Both components attempted to use location-based filtering
- Admin management component had location-related UI elements

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Database Layer (`/app/api/markup-documents/route.ts`)
```typescript
// REMOVED location parameter and references
- const location = searchParams.get('location')
+ // Note: location parameter removed as location column no longer exists

// REMOVED location field from formatted documents
- location: doc.location || 'shared',
+ // location field removed from schema
```

### 2. Admin Actions Layer (`/app/actions/admin/markup.ts`)
```typescript
// DEPRECATED location parameter 
- location?: 'personal' | 'shared'
+ _location?: 'personal' | 'shared', // Deprecated: location field removed from schema

// REMOVED location filtering
- if (location) { query = query.eq('location', location) }
+ // location filter removed as location column no longer exists

// UPDATED statistics logic
- const personalDocuments = documents?.filter((d: any) => d.location === 'personal').length || 0
+ const personalDocuments = 0 // No longer applicable
+ const sharedDocuments = totalDocuments // All documents are now unified
```

### 3. Component Layer Updates

#### Admin Management Component (`/components/admin/MarkupManagement.tsx`)
- Removed `locationFilter` state and related handlers
- Removed location-based bulk actions ("개인으로 변경", "공유로 변경")
- Removed location column from data table
- Removed location filter dropdown from UI
- Updated useEffect dependencies

#### Unified View Component (`/components/markup/list/markup-document-list.tsx`)
- Added comment noting location parameter removal
- Ensured no location-based filtering in API calls

### 4. Database Migration (`999_fix_markup_documents_rls_policies.sql`)
Created new migration to fix RLS policies:
- Dropped all existing policies referencing the `location` column
- Created new unified policies without location references
- Separate policies for admin and regular users
- Proper SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE policies

## Key Changes Summary

| Layer | Change | Impact |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Database** | Fixed RLS policies | ✅ Consistent access control |
| **API** | Removed location filtering | ✅ No more column errors |
| **Admin Actions** | Updated to unified schema | ✅ Consistent backend logic |
| **Components** | Removed location UI/logic | ✅ Consistent frontend behavior |

## Expected Results

After these fixes, both views should:

1. **Show identical data**: Both views now use the same API endpoint with `admin=true` parameter
2. **Display all 10 uploaded documents**: No location-based filtering to hide documents
3. **Have consistent performance**: No database errors from missing column references
4. **Maintain admin functionality**: Full admin management without location-based operations

## Testing

Created test script: `test-markup-api.js`
- Tests admin API endpoint
- Tests regular API endpoint  
- Tests stats endpoint
- Verifies data structure consistency

## Migration Required

Run the new migration to fix RLS policies:
```sql
-- supabase/migrations/999_fix_markup_documents_rls_policies.sql
```

This migration:
- Removes all broken RLS policies
- Creates new unified access policies
- Ensures proper admin and user access without location dependencies

## Verification Steps

1. **Database Migration**: Apply `999_fix_markup_documents_rls_policies.sql`
2. **Build Check**: Run `npm run build` to verify no compilation errors
3. **Component Testing**: Verify both views show the same 10 documents
4. **Admin Functions**: Test that admin management works without location features
5. **API Testing**: Use `node test-markup-api.js` to verify API consistency

## Notes

- The `location` concept (personal/shared) has been completely removed from the system
- All documents are now treated as unified/shared by default
- Admin users can access all documents regardless of creator
- Regular users can only access their own documents
- The fix maintains backward compatibility while removing broken functionality
