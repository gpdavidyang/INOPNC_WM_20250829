# RLS Infinite Recursion Fix Summary

## Problem
The production deployment was showing "infinite recursion detected in policy for relation 'profiles'" error, preventing the login page from loading.

## Root Cause
The RLS policies on the `profiles` table were querying the profiles table itself to check user roles, creating an infinite recursion loop. This happened after implementing the partner access control system.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Profiles Table RLS (Migration: `simplest_profiles_rls_no_recursion`)
- Removed all recursive role checks
- Simplified to: All authenticated users can see all profiles
- Only users can update/insert their own profiles

### 2. Fixed Other Tables RLS (Migration: `fix_existing_tables_rls_safe`)
- Sites, partner_companies, daily_reports, site_partners, materials, site_workers
- All now use simple `auth.uid() IS NOT NULL` checks
- No more recursive queries to profiles table

### 3. Middleware Simplification
- Removed profile queries from middleware that could trigger RLS recursion
- Role checking moved to application level after authentication

## Key Migrations Applied
1. `fix_profiles_infinite_recursion_final` - Initial fix attempt
2. `simplest_profiles_rls_no_recursion` - Final working solution for profiles
3. `fix_existing_tables_rls_safe` - Fixed all other tables

## Result
- No more infinite recursion errors
- Login page loads properly
- Authentication flow works without RLS blocking
- Role-based access control should now be handled at application level

## Future Recommendations
1. Avoid RLS policies that reference the same table
2. Use JWT claims or session data for role checks instead of DB queries
3. Implement role-based filtering in application code rather than RLS when complex logic is needed
