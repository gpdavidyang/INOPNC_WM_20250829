Summary:

1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user provided a single explicit request: "진행해줘" (continue), instructing me to continue the authentication consolidation work that was in progress from a previous session. This
   specifically meant continuing to update components throughout the mobile application to use the new UnifiedAuthProvider instead of fragmented authentication implementations like
   `useMobileUser`.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Next.js mobile application architecture with TypeScript
   - React hooks and authentication state management
   - Supabase authentication integration
   - UnifiedAuthProvider pattern for consolidating authentication
   - Component refactoring and import modernization
   - Mobile-first authentication patterns with role-based access
   - Materials management system with inventory tracking
   - Authentication hook migration patterns
   - React context providers and custom hooks

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `/Users/davidyang/workspace/INOPNC_WM_20250829/app/mobile/materials/page.tsx` - **MOST IMPORTANT**: This is the primary file that was successfully updated - Contains comprehensive materials management system with inventory, requests, and history - **SUCCESSFULLY UPDATED**: Import changed from `import { useMobileUser } from '@/modules/mobile/hooks/use-mobile-auth'` to `import { useUnifiedAuth } from 
'@/providers/unified-auth-provider'` - **SUCCESSFULLY UPDATED**: Hook usage updated from `const { profile, isSiteManager } = useMobileUser()` to `const { profile, isSiteManager } = useUnifiedAuth()` - File includes material inventory tracking, request management, and usage history with Korean interface

   - `/Users/davidyang/workspace/INOPNC_WM_20250829/modules/mobile/pages/documents-page-v2.tsx`
     - Document management system with upload capabilities
     - Already updated to use unified authentication
     - Uses `const { profile } = useUnifiedAuth()`

   - `/Users/davidyang/workspace/INOPNC_WM_20250829/modules/mobile/pages/attendance-page.tsx`
     - Attendance tracking system with check-in/check-out functionality
     - Already updated to use UnifiedAuthProvider
     - Uses `const { profile, isWorker, isSiteManager } = useUnifiedAuth()`

   - `/Users/davidyang/workspace/INOPNC_WM_20250829/modules/mobile/components/layout/Drawer.tsx`
     - Mobile drawer navigation component
     - Already updated to use UnifiedAuthProvider
     - Key code: `const { profile, loading: profileLoading, user, refreshProfile, signOut } = useUnifiedAuth()`

   - `/Users/davidyang/workspace/INOPNC_WM_20250829/app/mobile/notifications/page.tsx`
     - Notification system implementation with comprehensive notification management
     - **STILL NEEDS UPDATE**: Contains `const { profile } = useMobileUser()` that needs to be updated to `useUnifiedAuth`
     - This file was identified as the next component requiring authentication consolidation

4. Errors and fixes:
   - No errors encountered during this session. The work proceeded smoothly as it was following established patterns from previous authentication consolidation work.

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully identified the remaining components that need authentication consolidation. The materials page was found to still use the old `useMobileUser` hook and was successfully updated
   to use the `useUnifiedAuth` provider. The systematic approach of reading files and identifying authentication patterns has been effective in completing the migration.

6. All user messages:
   - "진행해줘" (continue) - The user requested to continue the authentication consolidation work that was in progress

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Update notifications page to use UnifiedAuthProvider (identified as next component needing update)
   - Complete authentication consolidation across all mobile components

8. Current Work:
   I just completed updating the materials page (`/Users/davidyang/workspace/INOPNC_WM_20250829/app/mobile/materials/page.tsx`) to use UnifiedAuthProvider. I successfully made both necessary
   changes:
   1. Updated the import statement from `import { useMobileUser } from '@/modules/mobile/hooks/use-mobile-auth'` to `import { useUnifiedAuth } from '@/providers/unified-auth-provider'`
   2. Updated the hook usage within the component from `const { profile, isSiteManager } = useMobileUser()` to `const { profile, isSiteManager } = useUnifiedAuth()`

   This completes the authentication consolidation for this component, which was one of the last major components that needed to be updated.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Update the notifications page at `/Users/davidyang/workspace/INOPNC_WM_20250829/app/mobile/notifications/page.tsx` to use UnifiedAuthProvider, as it was observed to still use the
   `useMobileUser` hook on line 18: `const { profile } = useMobileUser()`. This would be the final component to update to complete the unified authentication migration across all mobile
   components, directly continuing the authentication consolidation work requested with "진행해줘"..
   Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.
